# acme-ruleengine


## Prerequisites

### Python > 2.7

### Django

### Pyke

Pyke is a generic rules engine written in Python.  Because it is not available via pip, it must be fetched and manually built.  Follow this procedure:

1. wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke/files/latest/download
2. tar -xvf *.zip
3. cd pyke-1.1.1
4. python setup.py install

(note: the last step may require sudo)

To test open the python interpreter and enter the following:

import pyke

If there is an error there is a path issue.  Try installing pyke again.
